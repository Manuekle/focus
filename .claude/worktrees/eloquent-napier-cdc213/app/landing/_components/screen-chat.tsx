/**
 * The chat, as `app/_components/agent-chat.tsx` renders it — and it is the one
 * screen where every part had to come from the app or it would read as a
 * generic assistant.
 *
 * Three things carry the look. A user message is a filled primary pill and an
 * assistant message has no surface at all; giving the assistant a grey bubble
 * is the single thing that stops a chat mockup looking like this product. Tool
 * calls are `ToolResult` — the terminal-icon disclosure with a coloured status
 * and a copy button — not the plain `Tool` header from `tool.tsx`, which is a
 * different component the chat has never used. And the model is chosen through
 * the app's own flow: a command palette over the screen, not a dropdown, which
 * is what `ModelPicker` actually opens.
 *
 * ── It plays ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This screen used to be one frame of a conversation that had already
 * happened. A still of an agent cannot show the thing being claimed: that it
 * takes a turn, calls a tool, finds nothing, and hands the conversation to a
 * person rather than inventing an answer. So a cursor drives it, on a loop —
 * pick the model, write the message, send it, watch the two tools run, read
 * the answer, start a new chat, again.
 *
 * The loop is the app's real order of operations, not a montage: the model
 * picker sits under the composer on an empty chat exactly as it does in the
 * product, the header with "New chat" only exists once there is a chat, and
 * the composer turns into a stop button while a turn is in flight.
 *
 * Nothing here is interactive — `ScreenFrame` marks the whole screen `inert`,
 * so the composer, the copy buttons and the feedback controls are out of the
 * tab order and the accessibility tree as well as unclickable. The pointer on
 * screen is the demo's, so it can never be confused with the visitor's own.
 */

/**
 * One lap, about twenty-two seconds.
 *
 * The `reach*` phases are the travel and the phase after each one is the
 * click, which is why they come in pairs: a cursor that lands and clicks in
 * the same beat reads as a cut between two screenshots. The long holds are
 * where a person would be reading — the answer, and the moment after it.

/**
 * The composer, as `app/_components/chat/chat-input.tsx` draws it.

 * A static twin rather than the component itself, and the two reasons are both
 * hard blockers. `ChatInput` holds its text in React state, and the demo types
 * by writing `node.value` straight onto the textarea — a controlled field
 * would throw every letter away on the next render, and re-rendering this
 * screen once per letter would re-render the sidebar with it. And it fetches
 * `/api/chat/agents` on mount to populate the `@` menu, which is a request the
 * marketing page has no business making.
 *
 * So the markup is copied and the behaviour is not: same double frame — a muted
 * outer one (`rounded-[20px] border-border/70 bg-muted/50 p-1.5` — the
 * attachment chips live in its gap —) holding the actual composer panel
 * (`rounded-[14px] border-border/50 bg-card p-4 shadow-xs`), same bare
 * textarea over a bottom bar, same attach and tools buttons, and the same send
 * control — a solid `size-9 rounded-2xl` square that turns into the
 * destructive stop button while a turn is in flight, which is the swap the
 * loop is built around. It replaced `PromptInput`, the pill with the round
 * submit floating inside it, which the chat stopped using and only
 * `/agents/[id]/chat` still does.

            its selected row into view — `t.scrollIntoView({block:"nearest"})`
            in its `ce()`, scheduled unconditionally — and `nearest` walks up
            every scrollable ancestor, the document included. The hero frame is
            672px tall in an 800px window, so it is nearly always part-way off
            screen, and opening the palette yanked the whole landing down to
            centre a row nobody had asked to see. Lenis then smoothed the jump
            into a slide, which is why it read as the page moving by itself.
      
            Nothing cmdk does was wanted here: filtering is off, the input is
            readOnly, the frame is `inert`, and the highlighted row is fixed by
            the script. What is left is a store that fights the page. So the
