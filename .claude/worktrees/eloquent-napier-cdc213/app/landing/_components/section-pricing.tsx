/**
 * What it costs, on the landing rather than one click away.
 *
 * The page used to send every visitor to `/pricing` to find out, which is one
 * navigation between "this looks useful" and "can I afford it" — and the two
 * questions are asked in the same breath. This is the short answer: three
 * plans, the headline figure, three lines each, and the full table still a
 * click away for anyone who wants the other five.
 *
 * The figures and the annual ratio come from `lib/plans.ts`, which the pricing
 * page reads too. Neither one holds a number of its own, so they cannot end up
 * quoting different prices for the same plan.

                    step brighter and a shadow one step deeper — the app's own
                    hover state, applied permanently, which is a card that
                    looks like it is being pointed at by nobody.

                    A fixture above it says the same thing in the page's own
                    language, and says it without inventing an accent colour
                    for a product that has none. The tube is inset well past
                    the card's sides so the two corners stay dark: a strip
                    light as wide as what it lights is a backlit panel.

                    The fixture's box sits on the card's top edge and the tube
                    lifts itself out of it; hanging the whole thing above the
                    card instead put the top of the cone above the card too,
                    and the brightest part of a cone is its first few pixels —
                    which is why this used to be a white blob over the word
                    "Pro" rather than a lamp over a card.

                    Rendered before the card and with no z-index, so the card's
                    opaque surface takes the rest of the cone. The pool below is
                    the half the screenshots deliberately do without: a card
                    ends on a hard edge and casts something, a screenshot ends
                    by going out of focus and cannot. */}
