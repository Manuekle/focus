 * always the point of masking them.
 *
 * Same construction as `.lp-veil` under the screenshots and for the same build
 * reason: the pipeline strips a hand-written `backdrop-filter`, so the blur is
 * carried on spans with utility classes.

          progressive blur sat *below* the window, over the empty gap and

            the whole fixture above the frame instead and the cone starts above
            it too, so the sliver that shows over the bezel is the brightest
            part of the wash: a smear along the top edge rather than a lamp.

            The tube is inset from the frame's sides by 14% each way, so it is
            shorter than what it lights. A fixture as wide as its subject is a
            backlit panel; one that is narrower throws a cone with edges, and
            the corners of the frame stay in the dark where they belong.

            Behind the frame, and by paint order rather than by `z-index`. Both
            fixtures are rendered *before* the frame and neither carries a
            z-index, so the frame's opaque `--card` covers the half of the cone
            that would otherwise fall across the interface — a screenshot with
            white poured down its first two hundred pixels is a screenshot you
            cannot read, and that is the failure mode of every landing page
            that discovered this effect. What survives is the tube, its bloom,
            and the light spilling past the window's edges, which is what you
            would actually see in a room.

            `-z-10` would have been the obvious way to say the same thing and
            it is wrong here: `.lp` paints its own `--background`, so a negative
            index does not put the beam behind the frame, it puts it behind the
            page.

            No pool under the foot, unlike the pricing card and the closing
            mark. A window whose bottom is being dissolved by the veil and lit
            from underneath at the same time is three treatments arguing over
            the same forty pixels — the wash erasing the edge, a glow insisting
            there is one, and the page under both. Light pools under objects
            that end; these end by going out of focus. One treatment at the
            foot, and it is the veil. */}

            These are screenshots. They are built out of the product's real
            components, so the chat mockup contains a real `<textarea>`, real
            copy buttons, real thumbs-up/thumbs-down, and the flow canvas
            contains a button on every node — 108 focusable controls across the
            five frames on this page, against 68 that a visitor can actually
            use. Tabbing from the header to the pricing button went through all
            of them, and a screen reader announced every one as an operable
            control that does nothing: the composer is `readOnly` with a no-op
            submit, the tool output is a fixed string.

            `pointer-events-none` was here and only solved the mouse. `inert`
            is the property that says "this subtree is a picture": out of the
            tab order, out of the accessibility tree, and no pointer events
            either, so it replaces the class rather than joining it. The
            animations are unaffected — they are driven by state and by writing
            to the nodes directly, not by dispatching events.

            The frame then has to say what it is, which is what `role="img"`
            and the label do: one image with a name, where there used to be a
