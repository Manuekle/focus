/**
 * The hand that drives the screens.
 *
 * The mockups on this page render the product's own components over a fixed
 * dataset, and until recently they rendered one frame of it: a conversation
 * that had already happened. A still of an agent cannot show the thing being
 * claimed — that it takes a turn, calls a tool and comes back — so the screens
 * play: a cursor travels the mockup, clicks the controls a person would click,
 * and the screen answers the way the app answers.
 *
 * ── Why GSAP, and why none of this is React state ────────────────────
 *
 * The first version animated the pointer by putting its position in React
 * state and letting a spring pick it up. That is the wrong shape for this
 * twice over. The pointer moved on a re-render, so every frame of travel
 * re-rendered the whole mockup — sidebar, nav, every card — and the press
 * animation was a second piece of state racing the first: the ring could fire
 * while the cursor was still travelling, so the click landed on nothing.
 *
 * Now the pointer is a DOM node GSAP writes transforms onto. React renders it
 * once and never again, the travel and the press are one timeline each so a
 * press cannot start before its travel finished, and a lap of the script costs
 * the fifteen re-renders its fifteen phases are worth instead of one per
 * frame.
 *
 * Four pieces, and every flow needs the same four:
 *
 *   `useDemoLoop`   the script — ordered phases and how long each one holds
 *   `useStageLive`  when it may run: on screen, tab in front, motion allowed
 *   `DemoCursor`    the pointer, driven through a `CursorApi` handle
 *   `useTypewriter` text typed straight into an input, no render per letter
 *
 * The frame is `inert` (see `ScreenFrame`), so none of this competes with a
 * real cursor: what the visitor's own pointer does over the mockup is nothing,
 * which is what makes a simulated one honest rather than confusing. `inert`
 * also keeps the mockup's hundred-odd buttons out of the tab order and the
 * accessibility tree, which `pointer-events-none` — what used to be here —
 * never did.
 *
 * None of the steps below dispatch events or move focus: the cursor is a
 * rendered element and `useTypewriter` writes to the node directly, so an
 * inert subtree animates exactly as it did.
