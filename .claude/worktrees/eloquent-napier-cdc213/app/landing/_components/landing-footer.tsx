 * twenty ways to be bounced, and it read as a template precisely because a
 * template is the only thing that would list a product's internal navigation

 *
 * What is left is what a stranger can actually open: the sections of the page

 * the footer, competing with the sentence it sits beside; an outline is a
 * diagram. They are set at 42% radius rather than round, which is the squircle
 * the whole interface is drawn in.
 *

 * was set at 12px in the bottom bar next to a theme toggle, which is where a
 * page puts text it does not expect anyone to read. It is the most specific

 * reader is on the page at all, so it moved up beside the wordmark, at a size
 * you can read, under a label that says what it is.
